# Code-Playground

Full stack application with Node js, Mysql, Express and ejs
===

Challenge yourself by learning how to code while you are having fun in the playground! It is very simple, you can start by building a wire-frame with HTML, use your imagination to enhance the look of it with CSS, and add a little bit of JavaScript to create a fully functional application of your own. Save your code as flash cards, test it, and go back to the flashcards anytime that you want with the Flashcard App. Do you accept the challenge?
